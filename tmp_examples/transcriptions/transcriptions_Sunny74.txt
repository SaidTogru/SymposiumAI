2024-06-13T09:10:21.132Z - and now we are speaking that's a test
2024-06-13T09:10:26.720Z - test text transcription one two three
2024-06-13T09:10:31.700Z - let me see if everything yes here is it
2024-06-13T09:10:40.616Z - so everything got transcripted
2024-06-13T09:11:02.904Z - and yeah as I said together from now on here we have to implement just this and then connect this to the large language model or from you Marco and then we're finished basically
2024-06-13T09:11:23.821Z - and then of course I think the hardest thing or the most difficult thing will be the presentation video because this runs on local host so I can stream for example instead of my screen a video of some guy that we don't know it
2024-06-13T09:11:37.117Z - and but we would only have on one user so maybe I can do that with two laptops or two PCs
2024-06-13T09:11:43.002Z - at my localhost but we can't do that together this is the problem
2024-06-13T09:11:49.108Z - 
2024-06-13T09:11:57.629Z - I yeah but on localhost on lmu I don't know how to enable
2024-06-13T09:12:01.505Z - the excess
2024-06-13T09:12:06.117Z - yeah because
2024-06-13T09:12:15.202Z - yeah I don't know if that will work because you have to
2024-06-13T09:12:20.919Z - you have to Freeport from the router so
2024-06-13T09:12:30.811Z - basically all the all the things that you send to the router gets back to local host in the same network
2024-06-13T09:12:43.118Z - so in unknown networks where you don't have access to the router it's difficult to do but we we can try it out
2024-06-13T09:12:48.503Z - I will yeah okay
2024-06-13T09:12:51.711Z - that's all to that
